# SQUIRTLE

SQUIRTLE is a rideshare application designed specifically for UCLA students. Our goal is to enhance the university transportation experience, with a vision to expand to all universities. We aim to transform campus commutes, making them more efficient and affordable.

Our application is a way for students to find and create rides, and coordinate with students going on the same trips as them.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/razorback4417/squirtle.git
```

2. Navigate into the main project folder
```bash
cd squirtle
```

3. Install the project dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
4. Navigate into the `squirtleride` folder and start the development server
